# Delete Exam Functionality - Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Overview

The Delete Exam functionality has been implemented according to the specified requirements with a two-step validation and confirmation process.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **Step 1: Exam Code Input**
- Admin clicks "Delete Exam" button from the main QuestionBank Management interface
- A modal opens asking the admin to enter the Exam_Code to be deleted
- Input field with auto-uppercase conversion for consistency
- Real-time validation with helpful error messages
- Shows available exam codes for reference

### **Step 2: Validation**
- System validates the entered exam code against active exam codes from QuestionBank
- If exam code is **not found**: Shows error message and prevents deletion
- If exam code is **valid**: Proceeds to confirmation step
- Case-insensitive matching for user convenience

### **Step 3: Confirmation Dialog**
- Displays the exam code to be deleted prominently
- Shows warning about permanent deletion
- Explains that all associated clips will be removed
- Requires explicit confirmation to proceed

### **Step 4: Deletion Process**
- Sends DELETE request to backend API
- Backend deletes all rows with matching Exam_Code from QuestionBank sheet
- Returns count of deleted clips for confirmation
- Updates UI with success message including deletion count

## 🚀 User Workflow

```
1. Admin clicks "Delete Exam" button
   ↓
2. Modal opens: "Enter Exam Code to Delete"
   ↓
3. Admin types exam code (e.g., "PK95")
   ↓
4. System validates exam code exists
   ↓
5. If valid: Shows confirmation dialog
   If invalid: Shows error and stays on input step
   ↓
6. Admin confirms deletion
   ↓
7. System deletes all clips with that exam code
   ↓
8. Success message shows number of clips deleted
```

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### **Frontend Components**

#### **State Management**
```javascript
const [showDeleteModal, setShowDeleteModal] = useState(false);
const [deleteExamCode, setDeleteExamCode] = useState('');
const [deleteConfirmationStep, setDeleteConfirmationStep] = useState('input');
```

#### **Key Functions**
- `handleDeleteExamInput()`: Opens modal and resets state
- `handleValidateExamCode()`: Validates exam code existence
- `handleDeleteExam()`: Performs actual deletion
- `handleCancelDelete()`: Cancels process and resets state

#### **Validation Logic**
```javascript
const examCodeExists = examCodes.some(code => 
  code.toLowerCase() === deleteExamCode.trim().toLowerCase()
);
```

### **Backend API**

#### **Endpoint**
```
DELETE /api/admin/exam/:examCode
```

#### **Process**
1. Fetch all data from QuestionBank sheet
2. Find rows matching the exam code (case-insensitive)
3. Delete rows in reverse order to maintain indices
4. Return deletion count

#### **Response**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Exam PK95 deleted successfully",
  "examCode": "PK95",
  "deletedCount": 2,
  "timestamp": "2025-09-10T17:30:00.000Z"
}
```
